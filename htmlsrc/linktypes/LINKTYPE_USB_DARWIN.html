                <h3 class="subtitle">Description</h3>
<p>
All multi-byte fields are little-endian.
</p>
<p>
The version number field is a 2-octet value with the upper 8 bits
giving the major version number, the next 4 bits giving the minor
version number, and the next 4 bits giving the sub-minor version number.
The current version is 1.0.0, so the value is <code>0x0100</code>.
<p>
The length field indicates how long the header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 32; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the endpoint type.
</p>
<p>
The request type field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if this packet indicates a submitted request;</li>
<li>1, if this packet indicates a completed request.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The "amount of data requested/transferred" field indicates how much data
was requested or transferred by the request.
</p>
<p>
The returned status field contains a status value for the request.  A
status value has a system identifier in the upper 6 bits, a subsystem
identifier in the next 12 bits down, and a per-subsystem error code in
the lower 14 bits.  The system identifier is usually 0, for "kernel"; if
the system identifier is 0 and the subsystem identifier is 3, for
"Unix", the code is a Darwin errno value.
</p>
<p>
For an isochronous endpoint, the "number of isochronous frames
following" field indicates the number of isochronous frames in the
packet.  For other endpoints, it is 0.
</p>
<p>
The unique ID field contains an identifier for the operation; this will
be the same for all packets for a request, so that it can be used to
match submitted and completed requests.
</p>
<p>
The locationID field contains a value that describes the bus topology to
which the device is connected.  The upper 8 bits contain the bus number;
all subsequent 4-bit fields correspond to the port numbers through which
the device is connected, so that, for example, a device on bus 26
that is connected to port 1 of the hub that is connected to root port 1 on
the host controller would have a locationID of <code>0x1a110000</code>.  If there are
fewer than 6 ports in the route, the unused port number fields are zero.
</p>
<p>
The endpoint speed field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, for Low Speed;</li>
<li>1, for Full Speed;</li>
<li>2, for High Speed;</li>
<li>3, for SuperSpeed;</li>
<li>4, for SuperSpeedPlus.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The device address field contains a device address in the lower 7 bits;
the uppermost bit is clear.
</p>
<p>
The endpoint address and direction field contains an endpoint number in
the lower 4 bits and a direction indicator in the uppermost bit; if the
uppermost bit is 0, the endpoint is an OUT endpoint, and if the
uppermost bit is 1, the endpoint is an IN endpoint.
</p>
<p>
The endpoint type field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, for control;</li>
<li>1, for isochronous;</li>
<li>2, for bulk;</li>
<li>3, for interrupt.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For non-isochronous endpoints:
<ul>
<li>If the packet indicates a completed request, the payload is the data
transferred.</li>
<li>If the packet indicates a submitted request, then if the endpoint is
is the Default Control Pipe, the payload is the setup data as specified
in section 9.3 "USB Device Requests" of the USB 2.0 specification,
otherwise there is no payload.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For isochronous endpoints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the packet indicates a completed request, the payload is a
sequence of "number of isochronous frames following" isochronous frames. 
Each isochronous frame begins with 0&ndash;3 bytes of padding to put the
data following it on a 4-byte boundary.  After that is a header of the
form:
<pre>
+----------------------------------------+
|             Length of header           |
|                (4 Octets)              |
+----------------------------------------+
|               Frame length             |
|                (4 Octets)              |
+----------------------------------------+
|               Frame status             |
|                (4 Octets)              |
+----------------------------------------+
|               Frame number             |
|                (8 Octets)              |
+----------------------------------------+
|                Time stamp              |
|                (8 Octets)              |
+----------------------------------------+
</pre>
<p>
The length field indicates how long the header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 28; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the time in which the frame completed.
</p>
<p>
The frame length field indicates how many bytes of data are in the
frame.
</p>
<p>
The frame status field contains a status value for the frame.  It is in
the same format as the returned status field in the packet header.
</p>
<p>
The frame number field is the frame number, from the Start-of-Frame
packet, as specified by section 8.3.3 "Frame Number Field" of the USB
2.0 specification, on which this frame was scheduled/executed by the
controller.
</p>
<p>
The time stamp field is time at which the frame completed.  It is a Mach
absolute time, so it is a time in platform-dependent units; no
indication of the units on the platform on which the capture was
performed is available.
</p>
<p>
Following the header is the data for the frame; the frame length field
indicates how many bytes of data there are for that frame.
</p>
<li>If the packet indicates a submitted request, the payload is a
sequence of "number of isochronous frames following" isochronous frame
headers, with the frame length set to the number of bytes to be
transferred, the frame status field set to <code>0xe0000001</code>, and without any
data following the header.</li>
