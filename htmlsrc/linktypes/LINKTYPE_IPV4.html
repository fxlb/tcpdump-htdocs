<p>
Packets are IPv4 datagrams beginning with an IPv4 header.
</p>

<p>
This should only be used for traffic that consists solely of IPv4
packets, and in which IPv6 packets should be considered errors.  For all
other IP traffic without link-layer headers, including mixed IPv4 and
IPv6 traffic, <a href="LINKTYPE_RAW.html">LINKTYPE_RAW</a> should be
used.
