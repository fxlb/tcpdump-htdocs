The packets are Bluetooth Low Energy air interface Link Layer packets:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
A packet using the LE Uncoded PHYs (LE 1M PHY and LE 2M PHY), as defined
in Volume 6, Part B, Section 2.1 "Packet format for the LE Uncoded PHYs"
of the Bluetooth Core Specification, is represented as the four-octet
access address, immediately followed by the PDU and CRC; it does not
include the preamble.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A packet using the LE Coded PHY, as defined in Volume 6, Part B, Section
2.2 "Packet format for the LE Coded PHY" of the Bluetooth Core
Specification, is represented as the four-octet access address, followed
by the Coding Indicator (CI), stored in a one-octet field with the lower
2 bits containing the CI value, immediately followed by the PDU and the
CRC; it does not include the preamble.  Packets using the LE Coded PHY
are represented in an uncoded form, so the TERM1 and TERM2 coding
terminators are not included in the LE packet field.
