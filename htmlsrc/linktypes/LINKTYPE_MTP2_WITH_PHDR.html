<p>
The Direction field is 0 if the packet is going over the link in one
direction and 1 if it's going over the link in the other direction. If
the capture is being done by the device sending and receiving the
packets, 0 should be used for packets received by the device and 1
should be used for packets sent by the device.
</p>
<p>
The Extended Sequence Numbers used field is 0 if extended sequence
numbers, as specified by Annex A of <a class=away
href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.703/en/">ITU-T Recommendation
Q.703</a>, are not being used, 1 if extended sequence numbers are being
used, and 2 if it is unknown whether extended sequence numbers are being
used.
</p>
<p>
The Link number field is in big-endian byte order, and indicates the
number of the signaling link.
<p>
The MTP2 frame is a Signaling System No. 7 Message Transfer Part Level
2 (MTP2) packet, as specified by section 2.2 "Signal unit format" of <a
class=away href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.703/en/">ITU-T
Recommendation Q.703</a> (note that the fields in Figure 3 are
transmitted in right-to-left order).  The packet does not include the
check bits.  The packet is not bit-stuffed, so it includes no flag
fields.
