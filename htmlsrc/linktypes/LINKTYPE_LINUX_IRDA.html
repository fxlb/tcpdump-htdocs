<p>
The packet type field is in big-endian byte order.  The upper
octet of the field is the class of the packet; the value is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if the payload is an IrDA frame;</li>
<li>1, if the payload is a log message.</li>
</ul>
<p>For IrDA frames, the lower octet of the field is 0 for incoming
packets and 4 for outgoing packets.
<p>For log messages, if the lower octet of the field is 1, it's an
indication that one or more messages have been missed and not captured.
<p>
The <code>ARPHRD_</code> type field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer address length field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer address field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The protocol type field is in big-endian byte order; it should contain
the value <code>0x0017</code>.
</p>
<p>
The payload is an IrDA frame beginning with the IrLAP header as
defined by
<a class=away href="https://archive.org/details/ir-lap-11">Serial
