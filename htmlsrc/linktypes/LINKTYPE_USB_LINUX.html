                <h3>Description</h3>
<p>
A packet corresponds either to a URB submitted to the USB subsystem, a
completion report for a URB, or an error report for a URB.
</p>
All fields are in host byte order:
<ul>
<li>
<p>
  When performing a live capture, the host byte order is the byte order
  of the machine on which the packets are being captured.
</p>
<li>
<p>
  When reading a pcap file, the host byte order is the byte order for
  the file, as specified by the file's magic number.
</p>
<li>
<p>
  When reading a pcapng file, the host byte order is the byte order for
  the section of the pcapng file in which the packet appears, as
  specified by that section's Section Header Block.
</p>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The URB ID field is a unique ID for the URB to which this packet refers.
</p>
<p>
The event type field is an ASCII character that indicates type type of
the event; it is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>'S' (0x53), if the event is a submission of a URB;</li>
<li>'C' (0x43), if the event is a completion report for a URB;</li>
<li>'E' (0x45), if the event reports an error from a URB
submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The transfer type field has a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if the transfer to which the URB applies is a isochronous
transfer;</li>
<li>1, if the transfer to which the URB applies is a interrupt
transfer;</li>
<li>2, if the transfer to which the URB applies is a control
transfer;</li>
<li>3, if the transfer to which the URB applies is a bulk transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The uppermost bit of the endpoint number and transfer direction field
is 1 if the transfer is an input transfer and 0 if it is an output
transfer. The lowr 7 bits of the field contain the endpoint number.
</p>
<p>
The setup flag field is zero if the event is a submission of a URB for a
control transfer and non-zero otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The data flag field is zero if the event conains data and non-zero if it
contains no data.
</p>
<p>
The timestamp fields contain a time stamp for the event, in seconds and
microseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC; this MUST be the same as
the timestamp for the packet.
</p>
<p>
The status field contains zero if no error is being reported by the
event or the negative of a Linux errno value for the error being
reported if an error is being reported by the event.
</p>
<p>
If the setup flag is zero, the setup/isochronous infomration field
contains the setup data for a setup packet, as specified in the USB
standard.
</p>
<p>
If the setup flag is non-zero, and the transfer is an isochronous
transfer, the setup/isochronous information field contains:
</p>
<pre>
+----------------------------------------+
|              Error count               |
|               (4 Octets)               |
+----------------------------------------+
|         Number of descriptors          |
|               (4 Octets)               |
+----------------------------------------+
</pre>
<p>
where the error count field is the number of errors in the isochronous
transfer and the number of descriptors field is the number of
isochronous descriptors for the transfer.
</p>
<p>
If the setup flag is non-zero, and the transfer is not an isochronous
transfer, the setup/isochronous information field does not contain any
information and should be ignored.
</p>
<p>
The data, if any, for the event follows the setup/isochronous
information field.
