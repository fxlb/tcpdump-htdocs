<p>
The version field is 2 for the current version of the pseudo-header.
</p>
<p>
The family field is a Solaris <code>AF_</code> value, so it's 2 for IPv4 and 26 for
IPv6.
</p>
<p>
The hook type is in big-endian byte order; its value is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0 if the packet was received by the machine from another
machine;</li>
<li>1 if the packet was sent by the machine to another
machine;</li>
<li>2 if the packet was sent from the machine to itself, possibly
between zones.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The packet length is in big-endian byte order; its value is the number of
octets of packet data following the pseudo-header.
</p>
<p>
The interface index is in big-endian byte order; it is the interface index
of the interface on which the packet arrived.
</p>
<p>
The group interface index is in big-endian byte order; it is the group
interface index number, for IPMP interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The zone identifiers are in big-endian byte order.  A zone number of 0 is
the global zone; a zone number of <code>0xffffffff</code> means that the packet
arrived from another host on the network, not from another zone on the
same machine.
</p>
<p>
The payload is an IPv4 or IPv6 datagram, beginning with the IP header;
the family field indicates which it is.
