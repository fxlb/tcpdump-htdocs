<p>
The packet type field is in big-endian byte order; it contains
a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if the packet was sent to us by somebody else;</li>
<li>3, if the packet was sent to somebody else by somebody else;</li>
<li>4, if the packet was sent by us.</li>
</ul>
<p>For LAPD frames, the lower octet of the field is 0 for incoming
packets and 4 for outgoing packets.
<p>For log messages, if the lower octet of the field is 1, it's an
indication that one or more messages have been missed and not captured.
<p>
The <code>ARPHRD_</code> type field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer address length field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer address field is unused.
</p>
<p>
The protocol type field is in big-endian byte order; it should contain
the value <code>0x0030</code>.
</p>
<p>
The payload is a <a class=away
