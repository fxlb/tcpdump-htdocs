<p>This format supports classic CAN, CAN FD. and CAN XL frames.  The
same header is used for classic CAN and CAN FD frames; a different
header is used for CAN XL frames.
</p>
<p>
The <code>0x80</code> bit of the fifth octet of the header is clear for
CAN and CAN FD frames, and set for CAN XL frames.

                <h4>Description</h4>

<p>
The CAN ID and flags field is in network byte order (big-endian).
The bottom 29 bits contain the CAN ID of the frame.
The remaining bits are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>0x20000000</code> - set if the frame is an error message rather than a data frame.</li>
  <li><code>0x40000000</code> - set if the frame is a remote transmission request frame.</li>
  <li><code>0x80000000</code> - set if the frame is an extended 29-bit frame rather than a standard 11-bit frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The frame payload length indicates the number of bytes of payload
following the header.  All packet bytes after those bytes of payload are
padding.
</p>

<p>
The FD flags field contains CAN FD specific flags; for CAN frames, this
field is 0.  The bits are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CANFD_BRS</code> (<code>0x01</code>) - bit rate switch (second bitrate for payload data).</li>
  <li><code>CANFD_ESI</code> (<code>0x02</code>) - error state indicator of the transmitting node.</li>
  <li><code>CANFD_FDF</code> (<code>0x04</code>) - if set, the frame is a CAN FD frame; if not set,
the frame may be a CAN frame or a CAN FD frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Older software and firmware writing packets with this link type did not
use the <code>CANFD_FDF</code> flag for CAN FD frames, so if the <code>CANFD_FDF</code> flag is
not set, the frame is not guaranteed to be a CAN frame.  If that flag is
not set:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>if the frame size (including the header and padding) is 16, it's
   a CAN frame;
  <li>if the frame size (including the header and padding) is 72, it's
   a CAN FD frame.
</ul>

<p>
In addition, older software and firmware may not have explicitly set
that field, so that the bit corresponding to the <code>CANFD_FDF</code> flag might be
set even for classic CAN frames.  Therefore, code that reads
<code>LINKTYPE_CAN_SOCKETCAN</code> frames must perform some heuristic checks to make
sure that it doesn't incorrectly interpret a classic CAN frame as a CAN
FD frame, and code that generates <code>LINKTYPE_CAN_SOCKETCAN</code> frames must
follow certain rules to make sure that those checks don't cause
software that reads those fromes to treat a CAN FD frame as a classic
CAN frame.
</p>

<p>
Software that reads <code>LINKTYPE_CAN_SOCKETCAN</code> frames must not treat a frame
with the <code>CANFD_FDF</code> bit set as a CAN FD frame if any bits other than
<code>CANFD_BRS</code> and <code>CANFD_ESI</code> are set in that field, or if either of the
Reserved/Padding fields are non-zero, as that is an indication that the
header fields might not have been explicitly set, and the <code>CANFD_FDF</code> flag
might happen to be set even thugh the frame is not a CAN FD frame. 
</p>

<p>
Software that generates <code>LINKTYPE_CAN_SOCKETCAN</code> frames:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Must check the frame MTU when receiving frames from the Linux kernel in order to classify them as classic CAN frames or CAN FD frames.</li>
  <li>Must make the "FD flags" field 0 for classic CAN frames.</li>
  <li>Must set the <code>CANFD_FDF</code> bit of the "FD flags" field in CAN FD frames,
    and don't set any bits in that field other than the <code>CANFD_BRS</code> and <code>CANFD_ESI</code> bits
    unless and until Linux assigns them a meaning.</li>
  <li>Must make the "Reserved/Padding" fields 0 unless and until Linux assigns
that particular field a meaning.</li>
  <li>May strip trailing padding bytes to save disk space if all above statements are satisfied.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For a data frame, the payload is the data field of the CAN or CAN FD
packet.
<p>

<p>
For a remote retransmission request, the payload length must be 0, so
the payload is empty.
<p>

<p>
For an error message, the payload is always 8 bytes.  The lower bits of
the CAN ID field contain an error class value, with bits specified by
the first set of <code>CAN_ERR_</code> values in <a class=away
href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/can/error.h">the
Linux <code>uapi/can/error.h</code> header</a>.  The bytes in the payload are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>first byte - if arbitration was lost, the bit number in the bitstream in which it was lost;
otherwise 0. 
<li>second byte - the error status of the CAN controller, with bits
specified by the <code>CAN_ERR_CRTL_</code> bits in the Linux <code>uapi/can/error.h</code>
header.
<li>third byte - flags indicating a CAN protocol error type, with bits
specified by the <code>CAN_ERR_PROT_</code> bits in the Linux <code>uapi/can/error.h</code>
header.
<li>fourth byte - flags indicating a CAN protocol error location, with
bits specified by the <code>CAN_ERR_LOC_</code> bits in the Linux <code>uapi/can/error.h</code>
header.
<li>fifth byte - the error status of the CAN transceiver, with values
specified by the <code>CAN_ERR_TRX_</code> values in the Linux <code>uapi/can/error.h</code>
header.
<li>sixth, seventh, and eighth bytes - controller-specific additional
information.
</ul>

                <h4>Description</h4>
<p>
<em>Multi-byte integral-valued fields in this header are
little-endian, not big-endian as they are for fields in the classic CAN
and CAN FD header.</em>
</p>

<p>
The Prioritiy ID/VCID field is in little-endian byte order.
The bottom 11 bits contain the priority of the frame.  The 5 bits above
that are reserved.  The 8 bits above that contain a virtual CAN
network identifier (VCID).  The 8 bits above that are reserved.
</p>

<p>
The flags field contains CAN XL specific flags.  The bits are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CANFD_SEC</code> (<code>0x01</code>) - Simple Extended Context.</li>
  <li><code>CANXL_XLF</code> (<code>0x80</code>) - if set, the frame is a CAN XL frame; if not set,
the frame is a CAN frame or a CAN FD frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The SDU type field contains an indication of the higher-layer protocol
used by the payload.  The values of this field are specified by CAN in
Automation (CiA) specification 611-1 "CAN XL higher-layer functions -
Part 1: Definition of service data unit types (SDT)".
</p>

<p>
The frame payload length is in little-endian byte order.
It indicates the number of bytes of payload
following the header.  All packet bytes after those bytes of payload are
padding.
</p>

<p>
The Acceptance Field is in network byte order (big-endian).
