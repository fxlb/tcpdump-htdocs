<p>
The Direction field is zero if the frame was received by the host
that captured the traffic and non-zero if the frame was sent by that
host.
</p>
<p>
The PPP frame is as specified by <a class=away
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1661#section-2">Section 2
of RFC1661</a>.  If the first 2 octets are 0xff and 0x03, it's PPP in
HDLC-like framing, as specified by <a class=away
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1662#section-3.1">Section
3.1 of RFC1662</a>, but without flag octets, with the PPP header
following the address and conrol fields, otherwise it's PPP without
framing, and the packet begins with the PPP header.  The data in the
frame is not octet-stuffed or bit-stuffed.
