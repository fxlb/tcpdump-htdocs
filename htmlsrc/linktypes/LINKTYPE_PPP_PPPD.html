<p>
PPP frames, as specified by <a class=away
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1661#section-2">Section 2
of RFC1661</a>.
</p>
The frame is preceded by a header that is similar to the header for PPP
in HDLC-like framing, as specified by <a class=away
href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1662#section-3.1">Section
3.1 of RFC1662</a>.  However, the first octet of the header is not the
address field; instead, it is <code>0x00</code> if the frame was
received by the host that captured the traffic and <code>0x01</code> if
the frame was sent by that host.  The frame includs no flag octets, with
the PPP header following the direction and control fields.  The data in
the frame is not octet-stuffed or bit-stuffed.
