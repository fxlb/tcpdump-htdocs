<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Packets are Fibre Channel FC-2 frames, as specified in section 11 "Frame
Transmission and Reception" of <a
href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/incits/incits5452019">INCITS
545-2019, Fibre Channel - Framing and Signaling - 5</a>, beginning with an encoding
of the SOF and ending with an encoding of the EOF.  The encodings
represent the frame delimiters as 4-octet sequences representing the
corresponding ordered sets, with K28.5 represented as 0xBC, and the D
symbols as the corresponding octet values; for example, SOFi2, which is
K28.5 - D21.5 - D1.2 - D21.2, is represented as 0xBC 0xB5 0x55 0x55.
