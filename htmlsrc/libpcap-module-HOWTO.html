            <strong>WARNING:</strong> this document describes an unstable
            interface; future releases of libpcap may, and some probably will,
            change the interface in an incompatible fashion.  If you submit your
            module to the libpcap developers for inclusion in libpcap, not only
            does that make it more likely that it will be available in the
            libpcap provided by operating system vendors (such as Linux
            distributions), but it also means that we will attempt to update it
            to handle future changes to this interface.  If we add new
            capabilities, we may have to ask you how to provide those additional
            capabilities if you're using an underlying mechanism for which we
            have neither the source code nor the documentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> this document assumes familiarity with the
            entire libpcap API.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>TODO:</strong> more routines, more stuff that the activate
            routine has to do (such as setting the list of <code>DLT_</code>s)?
          </p>
          <p>
            On Linux, *BSD, macOS, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, illumos, Hurd and Haiku,
            Libpcap supports capturing on network interfaces as supported by the
            operating system networking stack, using the native packet capture
            mechanism provided by the OS.  On Windows, it supports it with the
            help of the driver and library supplied by WinPcap and Npcap.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, it also supports capturing on other types of devices,
            such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>specialized capture cards, such as Endace DAG cards;</li>
            <li>network adapters that provide special high-performance code
              paths, such as CSPI Myricom adapters;</li>
            <li>buses such as USB and CAN bus;</li>
            <li>software communication channels such as D-Bus and Linux netlink;
              </li>
            <li>etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Support for those devices is provided by modules compiled into
            libpcap.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title">Where to start</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            If you want to add such a module, you would first have to check
            <a href="linktypes.html">the list of link-layer header types
            supported by libpcap</a>, to see if one of those would be sufficient
            for your device.
          </p>
          <p>
            If none of those would work for your device, please follow the
            guidelines on the same page to request a new link-layer header type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a link-layer header type value or values that you can
            use, you can add new module.
          </p>
          <p>
            The module should be a C source file, with a name of the form
            <code>pcap-{MOD}.c</code>, where <code>{MOD}</code> is a name
            appropriate for your device; for example, the support for DAG cards
            is in <code>pcap-dag.c</code>, and the support for capturing USB
            traffic on Linux is <code>pcap-usb-linux.c</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your module is assumed to support one or more named devices.  The
            names should be relatively short names, containing only lower-case
            alphanumeric characters, consisting of a prefix that ends with an
            alphabetic character and, if there can be more than one device
            instance, possibly followed by a numerical device ID, such as
            <code>mydevice</code> or
            <code>mydevice0</code>/<code>mydevice1</code>/&hellip;  If you have
            more than one type of device that you can support, you can have more
            than one prefix, each of which can be followed by a numerical device
            ID.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two exported functions that your module must provide are
            routines to provide a list of device instances and a program to
            initialize a created-but-not-activated <code>pcap_t</code> for an
            instance of one of your devices.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title">The list device instances routine</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The "list of device instances" routine takes, as arguments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a pointer to a <code>pcap_if_list_t</code>;</li>
            <li>a pointer to an error message buffer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The error message buffer may be assumed to be
            <code>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</code> bytes large, but must not be assumed
            to be larger.  By convention, the routine typically has a name
            containing "findalldevs".
          </p>
          <p>
            The routine should attempt to determine what device instances are
            available and add them to the list pointed to by the first argument;
            this may be impossible for some modules, but, for those modules, it
            may be difficult to capture on the devices using Wirehshark
            (although it should be possible to capture on them using tcpdump,
            TShark, or other programs that take a device name on the command
            line), so we recommend that your routine provide the list of devices
            if possible.  If it cannot, it should just immediately return 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            The routine should add devices to the list by calling the
            <code>add_dev()</code> routine in libpcap, declared in the
            <code>pcap-int.h header</code>.  It takes, as arguments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the pointer to the <code>pcap_if_list_t</code> passed as an
              argument to the routine;
            </li>
            <li>
              the device name, as described above;
            </li>
            <li>
              a 32-bit word of flags, as provided by
              <a href="manpages/pcap_findalldevs.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_findalldevs</b></a>(3PCAP);
            </li>
            <li>
              a text description of the device, or <code>NULL</code> if there is
              no description;
            </li>
            <li>
              the error message buffer pointer provided to the routine.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <code>add_dev()</code> will, if it succeeds, return a pointer to a
            <code>pcap_if_t</code> that was added to the list of devices.  If it
            fails, it will return <code>NULL</code>; in this case, the error
            message buffer has been filled in with an error string, and your
            routine must return <code>PCAP_ERROR</code> to indicate the error.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your routine succeeds, it must return 0.  If it fails, it must
            fill in the error message buffer with an error string and return
            <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title">The initialize routine</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The "initialize the <code>pcap_t</code>" routine takes, as
            arguments:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              a pointer to a device name;
            </li>
            <li>
              a pointer to an error message buffer;
            </li>
            <li>
              a pointer to an <code>int</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          It returns a pointer to a <code>pcap_t</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your module will probably need, for each <code>pcap_t</code> for an
            opened device, a private data structure to maintain its own
            information about the opened device.  These should be allocated per
            opened instance, not per device; if, for example,
            <code>mydevice0</code> can be captured on by more than one program
            at the same time, there will be more than one <code>pcap_t</code>
            opened for <code>mydevice0</code>, and so there will be separate
            private data structures for each <code>pcap_t</code>.  If you need
            to maintain per-device, rather than per-opened instance information,
            you will have to maintain that yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The routine should first check the device to see whether it looks
            like a device that this module would handle; for example, it should
            begin with one of the device name prefixes for your module and, if
            your devices have instance numbers, be followed by a number.  If it
            is not one of those devices, you must set the integer pointed to by
            the third argument to 0, to indicate that this is
            <strong>not</strong> one of the devices for your module, and return
            <code>NULL</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it <strong>is</strong> one of those devices, it should call
            <code>pcap_create_common()</code>, passing to it the error message
            buffer as the first argument and the size of the per-opened instance
            data structure as the second argument.  If it fails, it will return
            <code>NULL</code>; you must return <code>NULL</code> in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it succeeds, the <code>pcap_t</code> pointed to by the return
            value has been partially initialized, but you will need to complete
            the process.  It has a <code>priv</code> member, which is a
            <code>void *</code> that points to the private data structure
            attached to it; that structure has been initialized to zeroes.
          </p>
          <p>
            What you need to set are some function pointers to your routines to
            handle certain operations:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>activate_op</code></dt>
            <dd>
              the routine called when
              <a href="manpages/pcap_activate.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_activate</b></a>(3PCAP)
              is done on the <code>pcap_t</code>
            </dd>
            <dt><code>can_set_rfmon_op</code></dt>
            <dd>
              the routine called when
              <a href="manpages/pcap_can_set_rfmon.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_can_set_rfmon</b></a>(3PCAP)
              is done on the <code>pcap_t</code>&mdash;if your device doesn't
              support 802.11 monitor mode, you can leave this as initialized by
              <code>pcap_create_common()</code>, as that routine will return
              "no, monitor mode isn't supported".
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            Once you've set the <code>activate_op</code> and, if necessary, the
            <code>can_set_rfmon_op</code>, you must return the
            <code>pcap_t *</code> that was returned to you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title">The activate routine</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            Your activate routine takes, as an argument, a pointer to the

          <p>
            Your routine should attempt to set up the device for capturing.  If
            it fails, it must return an error indication which is one of the
            <code>PCAP_ERROR</code> values.  For <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>, it
            must also set the <code>errbuf</code> member of the
            <code>pcap_t</code> to an error string.  For
            <code>PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</code> and
            <code>PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED</code>, it may set it to an error
            string providing additional information that may be useful for
            debugging, or may just leave it as a null string.

            does not, then, if that's because the device polls for packets
            rather than receiving interrupts or other signals when packets
            arrive, it should have a <code>struct timeval</code> in the private
            data structure, set the value of that <code>struct timeval</code> to
            the poll timeout, and set the <code>required_select_timeout</code>
            member of the <code>pcap_t</code> to point to the
            <code>struct timeval</code>.

        <h2 class="title">The read routine</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The <code>read_op</code> routine is called when
            <a href="manpages/pcap_loop.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_dispatch</b></a>(3PCAP),
            <a href="manpages/pcap_loop.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_loop</b></a>(3PCAP),
            <a href="manpages/pcap_next_ex.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_next</b></a>(3PCAP),
            or
            <a href="manpages/pcap_next_ex.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_next_ex</b></a>(3PCAP)
            is called.  It is passed the same arguments as
            <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() is called.
          </p>
          <p>
            The routine should first check if the <code>break_loop</code> member
            of the <code>pcap_t</code> is non-zero and, if so, set that member
            to zero and return <code>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, if the <code>pcap_t</code> is in blocking mode (as opposed to
            non-blocking mode), and there are no packets immediately available
            to be passed to the callback, it should block waiting for packets to
            arrive, using the buffering timeout, first, and read packets from
            the device if necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then it should loop through the available packets, calling the
            callback routine for each packet:
          </p>
<pre>
If the PACKET_COUNT_IS_UNLIMITED() macro evaluates to true when
passed the packet count argument, the loop should continue until
there are no more packets immediately available or the
break_loop member of the pcap_t is non-zero.  If the break_loop
member is found to be non-zero, it should set that member to
zero and return PCAP_ERROR_BREAK.

If it doesn't evaluate to true, then the loop should also
terminate if the specified number of packets have been delivered
to the callback.
</pre>
          <p>
            Note that there is <strong>NO</strong> requirement that the packet
            header or data provided to the callback remain available, or valid,
            after the callback routine returns; if the callback needs to save
            the data for other code to use, it must make a copy of that data.
            This means that the module is free to, for example, overwrite the
            buffer into which it read the packet, or release back to the kernel
            a packet in a memory-mapped buffer shared between the kernel and
            userland, after the callback returns.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an error occurs when reading packets from the device, it must set
            the <code>errbuf</code> member of the <code>pcap_t</code> to an
            error string and return <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no error occurs, it must return the number of packets that were
            supplied to the callback routine.
          </p>

        <h2 class="title">The inject routine</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The inject routine is passed a pointer to the <code>pcap_t</code>, a
            buffer containing the contents of the packet to inject, and the
            number of bytes in the packet.  If the device doesn't support packet
            injection, the routine must set the <code>errbuf</code> member of
            the <code>pcap_t</code> to a message indicating that packet
            injection isn't supported and return <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>.
            Otherwise, it should attempt to inject the packet; if the attempt
            fails, it must set the <code>errbuf</code> member of the
            <code>pcap_t</code> to an error message and return
            <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>.  Otherwise, it should return the number of
            bytes injected.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="title">The setfilter routine</h2>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>
            The setfilter routine is passed a pointer to the <code>pcap_t</code>
            and a pointer to a <code>struct bpf_program</code> containing a BPF
            program to be used as a filter.  If the mechanism used by your
            module can perform filtering with a BPF program, it would attempt to
            set that filter to the specified program.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that failed because the program was too large, or used BPF
            features not supported by that mechanism, the module should fall
            back on filtering in userland by saving a copy of the filter with a
            call to <code>install_bpf_program()</code>, setting a flag in the
            private data instructure indicating that filtering is being done by
            the module and, in the read routine's main loop, checking the flag
            and, if it's set, calling
            <a href="manpages/pcap_filter.3pcap.html"><b>pcap_filter</b></a>(3PCAP),
            passing it the <code>fcode.bf_insns</code> member of the
            <code>pcap_t</code>, the raw packet data, the on-the-wire length of
            the packet, and the captured length of the packet, and only passing
            the packet to the callback routine, and counting it, if
            <b>pcap_filter</b>() returns a non-zero value.  (If the flag is not
            set, all packets should be passed to the callback routine and
            counted, as the filtering is being done by the mechanism used by the
            module.)  If <code>install_bpf_program()</code> returns a negative
            value,  the routine should return <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the attempt to set the filter failed for any other reason, the
            routine must set the <code>errbuf</code> member of the
            <code>pcap_t</code> to an error message and return
            <code>PCAP_ERROR</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the attempt to set the filter succeeded, or it failed because the
            mechanism used by the module rejected it and the call to
            <code>install_bpf_program()</code> succeeded, the routine should
            return 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the mechanism the module uses doesn't support filtering, the
            pointer to the setfilter routine can just be set to point to
            <code>install_bpf_program()</code>; the module does not need a
            routine of its own to handle that.

            which packet directions should be accepted.  If the module can't
            arrange to handle only incoming packets or only outgoing packets, it
            can set the pointer to the setdirection routine to
            <code>NULL</code>, and calls to
