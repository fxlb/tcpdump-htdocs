        Season of Docs ideas

          To complement (I guess!) the Google Summer of Code, Google has started a
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/">Season of Docs</a>
          to "Let's bring open source and technical writer communities together, to
          the benefit of both."
        </p>

        <p>
          The Tcpdump Group maintains the tcpdump packet decoder and the libpcap capture
          library. libpcap is used by wide variety of <a href="related.html">network
          diagnostic tools</a>, including the very popular
          <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This web site contains many Unix-style man pages, most notably
          <a href="manpages/tcpdump.1.html"><b>tcpdump</b></a>(1)
          and <a href="manpages/pcap.3pcap.html"><b>pcap</b></a>(3PCAP), the latter of
          which links to 60-some more specific man pages.  In addition there is a set
          of <a href="linktypes.html">link-layer header types</a>, which describe the kind of
          information and meta-information that can be found in pcap files,
          and an ancient <a href="pcap.html">pcap tutorial</a>.  There is a
          <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, which does not address all present day issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some ideas for things to improve:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rewrite the man pages to provide better reference, removing tutorial
              contents, but including "contract" promises.</li>
            <li>Create higher-level documentation, with
              diagrams, to explain how to use libpcap to a programmer new to
              libpcap.</li>
            <li>Idem, to explain what is done where in libpcap source code.</li>
            <li>Explain tuning for better performance of libpcap, advanced details on
              Linux memory mapped packet interfaces, how to use threads with
              libpcap.</li>
            <li>Improve the
              <span class=manref><a href="manpages/pcap-filter.7.html"><b>pcap-filter</b></a>(7)</span>
              man page as suggested in
              <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/issues/125">this</a>
              libpcap bug report.</li>
            <li>In the FAQ explain why it is a good idea to run tcpdump with
              the <code>-n</code> flag at all times.</li>
            <li>Ibid., explain in detail the recommended way to build other software
              with libpcap using <code>pkg-config</code> and <code>pcap-config</code>.
              </li>
          </ul>
