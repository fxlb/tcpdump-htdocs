          This open source software has been incorporating various contributions
					from many people since its first public release in 1991 (see the
          <a href="old_releases.html">release history</a> page).  An unavoidably
          inaccurate (which hopefully can be forgiven) record of the source code
          contributors can be found in the <code>CREDITS</code> file in each git
          repository.  Also some organizations have donated various resources and
          services to help the project maintainers and contributors do their work
          and deliver the results to the users.
