                                 libpcapnav is a libpcap wrapper library that allows navigation
                                 to arbitrary locations in a tcpdump trace file between reads.
                                 The API is intentionally much like that of the pcap library.  You
                                 can navigate in trace files both in time and space: you can jump
                                 to a packet which is at appr. 2/3 of the trace, or you can jump
                                 as closely as possible to a packet with a given timestamp, and
                                 then read packets from there. In addition, the API provides
                                 convenience functions for manipulating <code>timeval</code>
                                 structures.

                                headers or packet blocks, and checks and repairs them.

                                tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP

                                protocol analysis or debugging.  A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
                                summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data
                                that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs
                                the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
                                later analysis.

                                Packet Filter (BPF) expression. The basic model is that you run
                                capstats as a daemon (as root), and it will then take commands from

                                Addrwatch is extremely useful in networks with IPv6
                                autoconfiguration (RFC 4862) enabled.  It allows to track IPv6
                                addresses of hosts using IPv6 privacy extensions (RFC 4941).
                                The main difference between arpwatch and addrwatch is the format
                                of output files.

                                It is able to give you a very detailed technical info on these
                                packets, as SEQ, ACK, TTL, Window, etc.  The packet contents also
                                can be viewed, in different formats (hex or plain text, etc.).

                                Cyberprobe is a network [deep] packet inspection toolkit for
                                real-time monitoring of networks.  This has applications in
                                network monitoring, intrusion detection, forensic analysis, and as
                                a defensive platform.  Cyberprobe packet inspection works on
                                physical networks, and also in cloud VPCs.  There are features
                                that allow cloud-scale deployments.  This is not a single,
                                monolithic intrusion detection toolkit which does everything you
                                want straight out of the box.  Instead, Cyberprobe is a set of
                                flexible components which can be combined in many ways to manage a
                                wide variety of packet inspection tasks.

                                NetHogs is a small "net top" tool. Instead of breaking the traffic
                                down per protocol or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups
                                bandwidth by process.  NetHogs does not rely on a special kernel
                                module to be loaded. If there's suddenly a lot of network traffic,
                                you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing
                                this.  This makes it easy to identify programs that have gone wild
                                and are suddenly taking up your bandwidth.  Since NetHogs heavily
                                relies on <code>/proc</code>, most features are only available on
                                Linux. NetHogs can be built on Mac OS X and FreeBSD, but it will
                                only show connections, not processes.

                                packets.  The output should be as useful as possible by default.

                                and editor, written in POSIX-compliant C, designed to complement
                                tcpdump by replaying captured traffic from pcap files onto live
                                networks. It supports Windows (using Npcap), Linux, BSD, and macOS,
                                allowing the editing of key fields in Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, IPv6,
                                ICMP, and TCP/UDP headers. It can also generate pcap files from
                                its built-in templates, enabling packet creation without existing
                                capture files, along with payload generation from uniformly

                                Wireshark. Ideal for testing firewalls, IDS, IPS, routers,
                                switches, load balancers, and other network equipment, it delivers
                                performance that matches the line rate of your NIC, up to 10Gbps.

                                sequence of port-hits.  When detected, it will run a specified event

                                versions) they are running, what type of packet
                                filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
                                characteristics.

                                SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS
                                encrypted network connections. It is intended to be useful for
                                network forensics, application security analysis and penetration
                                testing.  SSLsplit is designed to transparently terminate
                                connections that are redirected to it using a network address
                                translation engine.  SSLsplit then terminates SSL/TLS and initiates
                                a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination address, while
                                logging all data transmitted.  Besides NAT based operation,
                                SSLsplit also supports static destinations and using the server
                                name indicated by SNI as upstream destination.

                                dnsjit is a combination of parts taken from dsc, dnscap, drool,
                                and put together around Lua to create a script-based engine for
                                easy capturing, parsing and statistics gathering of DNS messages
                                while also providing facilities for replaying DNS traffic.

                                One of the core functionality that dnsjit brings is to tie
                                together C and Lua modules through a receiver/receive interface.
                                This allows creation of custom chains of functionality to meet
                                various requirements.  Another core functionality is the ability
                                to parse and process DNS messages even if the messages are
                                non-compliant with the DNS standards.

                                Packit (PACket toolKIT) is a network auditing tool.  It uses
                                libpcap and can make real packets (frames) that are able to travel
                                in a network.  Packit also allows one to add personalized
                                payloads.  Other good feature is the possibility to read dump
                                files created by tcpdump.

                                IP traffic.  By allowing you to define (spoof) nearly all TCP,
                                UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP, RARP, and Ethernet header options, Packit can
                                be useful for the following scenarios:

                                Packit is also an excellent tool for learning TCP/IP.  However,
                                this program does not support IPv6.
