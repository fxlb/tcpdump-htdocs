                <h3 class="subtitle">Description</h3>
<p>
All multi-octet fields currently appear to be little-endian, but Apple
haven't indicated whether this is by design or merely a consequence of
all Apple machines that write this format being little-endian.
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">
In the PKTAP version 1 header:
</h4>
<p>
The length field indicates how long the PKTAP header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 108; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the effective command name.
</p>
<p>
The record type field contains a value that is one of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, if nothing follows the PKTAP header;</li>
<li>1, if a packet follows the PKTAP header.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <code>DLT_</code> value field contains a macOS <code>DLT_</code> value for the packet, such as
<code>DLT_EN10MB</code> for an Ethernet packet.
</p>
<p>
The interface name contains a null-padded ASCII string giving the name
of the interface on which the packet arrived.  <em>Do not</em> assume
that there is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The flags field contains a set of flags for the packet:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x00000001</code> - packet is an incoming packet</li>
<li><code>0x00000002</code> - packet is an outgoing packet</li>
<li><code>0x00000004</code> - process is delegated</li>
<li><code>0x00000008</code> - interface is delegated</li>
<li><code>0x00002000</code> - header has a time stamp</li>
<li><code>0x00004000</code> - packet is from a new flow</li>
<li><code>0x00008000</code> - packet is a retransmission</li>
<li><code>0x00010000</code> - packet is a keep-alive packet</li>
<li><code>0x00020000</code> - packet is on a socket</li>
<li><code>0x00040000</code> - packet is on a nexus channel</li>
<li><code>0x00080000</code> - this packet has a version 2 PKTAP header</li>
</ul>
<p>
The flags field is at the same offset in the version 1 and version 2
headers; it should be checked for the "version 2 PKTAP header" flag
before any other fields, including the length, are interpreted.
<p>
The protocol family field contains a value indicating the address
family of the packet.  It may be 0 for "unknown", 2 for IPv4, or 30 for
IPv6.  It may also be another macOS <code>AF_</code> value; note that those values do
not necessarily correspond to the <code>AF_</code> value of the operating system on
the host reading a capture.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer header length field appears to contain the length of the
packet's link-layer header.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The link-layer trailer length field is assumed to contain the length of
the packet's link-layer trailer.  It may be 0.
</p>
<p>
The process ID field contains the process ID of the process that sent
the packet; it may be 0 if the process ID is unknown.
</p>
<p>
The command name contains a null-padded UTF-8 string giving the last
component of the path name of the executable image running in the
process that sent the packet, truncated to 20 characters.  It may be
a null string if the executable image name is unknown. <em>Do not</em>
assume that there is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The service class field contains one of the following values:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0, for "best effort";
<li>100, for "background system-initiated";
<li>200, for "background user-initiated";
<li>300, for "responsive data";
<li>400, for "operations, administration, and management";
<li>500, for "multimedia audio/video streaming";
<li>600, for "responsive multimedia audio/video";
<li>700, for "interactive video";
<li>800, for "interactive voice";
<li>900, for "network control".
</ul>
<p>
Note that these are priorities for which there is a total order; they
have different delay tolerance, loss tolerance, etc. characteristics.
</p>
<p>
<p>
The interface type field contains an SNMP <code>ifType</code> value for the
interface.
</p>
<p>
The "unit number of interface" field is assumed to contain the unit
number of the interface.
</p>
<p>
The effective process ID field is assumed to contain a process ID of
some sort; it may be 0 if the process ID is unknown.
</p>
<p>
The effective command name contains a null-padded UTF-8 string giving
the last component of the path name of the executable image running in
some process, truncated to 20 characters.  It may be a null string if
the executable image name is unknown.  <em>Do not</em> assume that there
is a NUL character at the end of the name.
</p>
<p>
The flow ID field contains a hash value computed for the flow to which
the packet belongs; it is 0 if there is no flow ID.
</p>
<p>
The IP protocol field contains a macOS <code>IPPROTO_</code> value for the packet; it
may be <code>IPPROTO_RAW</code> if the packet was written to a raw socket.
</p>
<p>
All fields following the effective command name field are optional; the
length field indicates how many fields are present.
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">
In the PKTAP version 2 header:
</h4>
<p>
The length field indicates how long the PKTAP header is; this value
includes the length of the length field itself.  It should be
at least 108; if it's larger, there is additional data in the header
following the effective command name.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of UUID" field is 0 if the UUID field is not present;
otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP header
of the UUID field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of effective UUID" field is 0 if the effective UUID field is
not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the effective UUID field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of interface name" field is 0 if the interface name field is
not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the interface name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of interface name" field is 0 if the interface name field is
not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the interface name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of effective interface name" field is 0 if the effective
interface name field is not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the
beginning of the PKTAP header of the effective interface name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of command name" field is 0 if the command name field is not
present; otherwise, it's the offset from the beginning of the PKTAP
header of the command name field.
</p>
<p>
The "offset of effective command name" field is 0 if the effective
command name field is not present; otherwise, it's the offset from the
beginning of the PKTAP header of the effective command name field. 
</p>
<p>
The <code>DLT_</code> value field contains a macOS <code>DLT_</code> value for the packet, such as
<code>DLT_EN10MB</code> for an Ethernet packet.
