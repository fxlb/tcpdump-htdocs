                <h3 class="subtitle">Description</h3>
<p>
All multi-octet fields are expressed in little-endian format.
Fields with a corresponding Flags bit are only considered valid
when the bit is set.
</p>
<p>
The RF Channel field ranges 0 to 78.  It reflects the value described in
Volume 2, Part A, Section 2 "Frequency bands and channel arrangement" of
the Bluetooth Core specification.
</p>
<p>
The Signal Power and Noise Power fields are signed integers expressing
values in dBm.
</p>
<p>
The Access Code Offenses field is an unsigned integer indicating the
number of deviations from the valid access code that led to the packet
capture.  Access codes are interpreted as described in Volume 2, Part B,
Section 6.3 "Access code" of the Bluetooth Core specification.
</p>
<p>
The Payload Transport Rate field represents a column in Volume 2, Part
B, Section 6.5 "Packet types", Table 6.2 of the Bluetooth Core
specification, and is interpreted as two nibbles as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x.0</code> indicates the BT payload was BR and captured with GFSK demodulation</li>
<li><code>0x.1</code> indicates the BT payload was EDR and captured with PI/2-DQPSK demodulation</li>
<li><code>0x.2</code> indicates the BT payload was EDR and captured with 8DPSK demodulation</li>
<li><code>0x0.</code> indicates the packet logical transport is any (link parameters unknown)</li>
<li><code>0x1.</code> indicates the packet logical transport is SCO</li>
<li><code>0x2.</code> indicates the packet logical transport is eSCO</li>
<li><code>0x3.</code> indicates the packet logical transport is ACL</li>
<li><code>0x4.</code> indicates the packet logical transport is CSB</li>
<li><code>0xff</code> indicates this is an ID packet so BT Packet Header is ignored and there is no payload</li>
</ul>
<p>
All other values of the Payload Transport Rate field are reserved.
</p>
<p>
The Corrected Header Bits field is an unsigned integer indicating the
number of corrected bits in the 18-bit BT Packet Header.  The valid
range is 0 to 18.
</p>
<p>
The Corrected Payload Bits field is a signed integer indicating the
number of errored and corrected bits in the captured BT payload.
Interpretation of this field corresponds to the Payload Transport Rate. 
The value ranges from 0 to 80 when the BT payload was captured at R=1/3
as per Volume 2, Part B, Section 7.4 "FEC code: rate 1/3" of the
Bluetooth Core specification.  The value ranges from -360 to +180 when
the BT payload was captured at R=2/3 as per Volume 2, Part B, Section
7.5 "FEC code: rate 2/3" of the Bluetooth Core specification.  A
negative number indicates the field absolute value is the sum of the
number of corrected and uncorrectable bits.
</p>
<p>
The Lower Address Part field is the 24-bit value recovered from the
captured SYNC WORD as defined in Volume 2, Part B, Section 6.3.3 "Sync
word" of the Bluetooth Core specification. The most significant octet
of this field is reserved and must be zero.
</p>
<p>
The Reference LAP field corresponds to
the Lower Address Part configured into the capture tool that led to the
capture of this packet.
</p>
<p>
The Reference UAP field corresponds to the
Upper Address Part configured into the capture tool and corresponds to
the Reference LAP.
</p>
<p>
The BT Packet Header field is the 18-bit value recovered from the packet
capture, and is defined in Volume 2, Part B, Section 6.4 "Packet header"
of the Bluetooth Core specification. The most significant 14 bits are
reserved and must be zero.
</p>
<p>
The Flags field represents packed bits defined as follows. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0x0001</code> indicates the BT Packet Header and BR or EDR Payload are de-whitened</li>
<li><code>0x0002</code> indicates the Signal Power field is valid</li>
<li><code>0x0004</code> indicates the Noise Power field is valid</li>
<li><code>0x0008</code> indicates the BR or EDR Payload is decrypted</li>
<li><code>0x0010</code> indicates the Reference LAP is valid and led to this packet being captured</li>
<li><code>0x0020</code> indicates the BR or EDR Payload is present and follows this field</li>
<li><code>0x0040</code> indicates the RF Channel field is subject to aliasing</li>
<li><code>0x0080</code> indicates the Reference UAP field is valid for HEC and CRC checking</li>
<li><code>0x0100</code> indicates the HEC portion of the BT Packet Header was checked</li>
<li><code>0x0200</code> indicates the HEC portion of the BT Packet Header passed its check</li>
<li><code>0x0400</code> indicates the CRC portion of the BR or EDR Payload was checked</li>
<li><code>0x0800</code> indicates the CRC portion of the BR or EDR Payload passed its check</li>
<li><code>0x1000</code> indicates the MIC portion of the decrypted BR or EDR Payload was checked</li>
<li><code>0x2000</code> indicates the MIC portion of the decrypted BR or EDR Payload passed its check</li>
</ul>
<p>
All other bit positions of the Flags field are reserved and must be
zero. 
</p>
<p>
The decoded BR or EDR Payload optionally follows the previous fields,
and is formatted as detailed in Volume 2, Part B, Section 6 "Packets" of
the Bluetooth Core specification.  The packet is decoded per Volume 2,
Part B, Section 7 "Bit stream processing" of the Bluetooth Core
specification.  All multi-octet values in the BR or EDR Payload are
always expressed in little-endian format, as is the normal Bluetooth
practice.
