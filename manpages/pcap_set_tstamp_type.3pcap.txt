PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_TYPE(3PCAP)                        PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_TYPE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_set_tstamp_type  - set the time stamp type to be used by a capture
       device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_tstamp_type(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_type);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_tstamp_type() sets the type of time stamp desired for  packets
       captured  on  the pcap descriptor to the type specified by tstamp_type.
       It must be called on a pcap descriptor  created  by  pcap_create(3PCAP)
       that    has   not   yet   been   activated   by   pcap_activate(3PCAP).
       pcap_list_tstamp_types(3PCAP) will give a list of the time stamp  types
       supported  by a given capture device.  See pcap-tstamp(7) for a list of
       all the time stamp types.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_tstamp_type() returns 0 on success if the specified time stamp
       type is expected to be supported  by  the  capture  device,  PCAP_WARN-
       ING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP  if  the  specified  time stamp type is not sup-
       ported by the capture device, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if called on a  cap-
       ture handle that has been activated, and PCAP_ERROR_CANTSET_TSTAMP_TYPE
       if the capture device doesn't support setting the time stamp type (only
       older  versions of libpcap will return that; newer versions will always
       allow the time stamp type to be set to the default type).

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.2.1.   In  previous
       releases,  the  time  stamp  type  cannot be set; only the default time
       stamp type offered by a capture source is available.
