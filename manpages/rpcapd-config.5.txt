RPCAPD-CONFIG(5)              File Formats Manual             RPCAPD-CONFIG(5)

NAME
       rpcapd-config - rpcapd configuration file format

DESCRIPTION
       An rpcapd configuration file allows parameters to be set for rpcapd(8).

       A  #  introduces  a  comment  that  runs to the end of the line.  Blank
       lines, and lines with only a comment, are ignored.  Leading and  trail-
       ing white space on a line are also ignored.

       Lines that set a parameter are of the form

              parameter=value

       Whitespace preceding or following the = is ignored.

       The parameters are:

       ActiveClient
              value  is  a host name or IP address, followed by a comma, semi-
              colon, or space, followed by a port name and address or DEFAULT.
              DEFAULT  specifies the default active mode port for rpcapd, port
              2003.  Each ActiveClient line adds the host and port to the list
              of clients to which the server should connect in active mode.

       PassiveClient
              value  is  a host name or IP address, followed by a comma, semi-
              colon, or space, followed by a port name and address or DEFAULT.
              DEFAULT specifies the default passive mode port for rpcapd, port
              2002.  Each PassiveClient line adds the host  and  port  to  the
              list  of clients addresses and ports that are allowed to connect
              to the server in passive mode.

       NullAuthPermit
              value is either YES or NO.  YES means that  null  authentication
              is permitted; NO means that it is not permitted.
