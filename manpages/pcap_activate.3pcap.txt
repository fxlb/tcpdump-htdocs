PCAP_ACTIVATE(3PCAP)                                      PCAP_ACTIVATE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_activate - activate a capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_activate(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_activate()  is used to activate a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network, with the options that were set  on  the  handle
       being in effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_activate() returns 0 on success without warnings, a non-zero posi-
       tive  value on success with warnings, and a negative value on error.  A
       non-zero return value indicates what warning  or  error  condition  oc-
       curred.

       The possible warning values are:

       PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP
              Promiscuous  mode  was requested, but the capture source doesn't
              support promiscuous mode.

       PCAP_WARNING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP
              The    time    stamp    type    specified    in    a    previous
              pcap_set_tstamp_type(3PCAP)  call isn't supported by the capture
              source (the time stamp type is left as the default),

       PCAP_WARNING
              Another  warning  condition  occurred;   pcap_geterr(3PCAP)   or
              pcap_perror(3PCAP)  may be called with p as an argument to fetch
              or display a message describing the warning condition.

       The possible error values are:

       PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED
              The handle has already been activated.

       PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE
              The capture source specified when the handle was created doesn't
              exist.

       PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED
              The process doesn't have permission to open the capture source.

       PCAP_ERROR_PROMISC_PERM_DENIED
              The process has  permission  to  open  the  capture  source  but
              doesn't have permission to put it into promiscuous mode.

       PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP
              Monitor  mode  was specified but the capture source doesn't sup-
              port monitor mode.

       PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP
              The capture source device is not up.

       PCAP_ERROR_CAPTURE_NOTSUP
              Packet capture is not supported on the capture source.

       PCAP_ERROR
              Another error occurred.  pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror()  may  be
              called  with  p as an argument to fetch or display a message de-
              scribing the error.

       If  PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP,  PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE,   PCAP_ER-
       ROR_PERM_DENIED,     or    PCAP_ERROR_CAPTURE_NOTSUP    is    returned,
       pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror() may be called with p as an  argument  to
       fetch or display an message giving additional details about the problem
       that might be useful for debugging the problem if it's unexpected.

       Additional  warning  and error codes may be added in the future; a pro-
       gram should check for positive, negative, and zero  return  codes,  and
       treat  all  positive  return  codes as warnings and all negative return
       codes as errors.  pcap_statustostr(3PCAP) can be called, with a warning
       or error code as an argument, to fetch a message describing the warning
       or error code.

       If pcap_activate() fails, the pcap_t * is  not  closed  and  freed;  it
       should be closed using pcap_close(3PCAP).
