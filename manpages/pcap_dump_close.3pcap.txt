PCAP_DUMP_CLOSE(3PCAP)                                  PCAP_DUMP_CLOSE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_dump_close - close a savefile being written to

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       void pcap_dump_close(pcap_dumper_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_dump_close() closes the ``savefile'' associated with p and deallo-
       cates resources. This means that, for example, if p refers to  a  save-
       file  that  was  opened  with pcap_dump_fopen(), the stream provided to
       that routine will be closed unless it is stdout.

SEE ALSO
       pcap(3PCAP), pcap_dump_open(3PCAP), pcap_dump(3PCAP)
