PCAP_DUMP_OPEN(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_DUMP_OPEN(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_dump_open, pcap_dump_open_append, pcap_dump_fopen - open a file to
       which to write packets

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open_append(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_fopen(pcap_t *p, FILE *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_dump_open() is called to open a ``savefile'' for  writing.   fname
       specifies  the  name  of  the file to open. The file will have the same
       format as those used by tcpdump(1) and tcpslice(1).  If the  file  does
       not exist, it will be created; if the file exists, it will be truncated
       and overwritten.  The name "-" is a synonym for stdout.

       pcap_dump_fopen() is called to write data to an  existing  open  stream
       fp;   this   stream   will   be   closed   by   a  subsequent  call  to
       pcap_dump_close(3PCAP).  The stream is assumed to be at  the  beginning
       of a file that has been newly created or truncated, so that writes will
       start at the beginning of the file.  Note that on Windows, that  stream
       should be opened in binary mode.

       p  is  a  capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an earlier call to
       pcap_create(3PCAP)   and   activated   by   an    earlier    call    to
       pcap_activate(3PCAP),    or    returned   by   an   earlier   call   to
       pcap_open_offline(3PCAP),           pcap_open_live(3PCAP),           or
       pcap_open_dead(3PCAP).   The time stamp precision, link-layer type, and
       snapshot length from p are used as the  link-layer  type  and  snapshot
       length of the output file.

       pcap_dump_open_append()  is  like pcap_dump_open() but, if the file al-
       ready exists, and is a pcap file with the same byte order as  the  host
       opening  the  file,  and  has the same time stamp precision, link-layer
       header type, and snapshot length as p, it will write new packets at the
       end of the file.

RETURN VALUE
       A   pointer   to   a  pcap_dumper_t  structure  to  use  in  subsequent
       pcap_dump(3PCAP) and pcap_dump_close(3PCAP) calls is returned  on  suc-
       cess.    NULL   is   returned   on   failure.   If  NULL  is  returned,
       pcap_geterr(3PCAP) can be used to get the error text.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       The pcap_dump_open_append() function became available  in  libpcap  re-
       lease  1.7.2.   In previous releases, there is no support for appending
       packets to an existing savefile.
