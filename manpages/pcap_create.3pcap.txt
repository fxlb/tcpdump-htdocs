PCAP_CREATE(3PCAP)                                          PCAP_CREATE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_create - create a live capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_create(const char *source, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_create()  is  used  to  create  a packet capture handle to capture
       packets   on   a   device   (typically   a   network   interface,   see
       pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP)  for a more detailed explanation).  source is a
       string that specifies the capture device to open, in this function NULL
       means the same as the string "any".  errbuf is a buffer large enough to
       hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.

       The returned handle must be activated with pcap_activate(3PCAP)  before
       packets  can be captured with it; options for the capture, such as pro-
       miscuous mode, can be set on the handle before activating it.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_create() returns a pcap_t * on success and NULL  on  failure.   If
       NULL  is  returned,  errbuf is filled in with an appropriate error mes-
       sage.
