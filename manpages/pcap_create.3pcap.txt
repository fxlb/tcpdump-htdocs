PCAP_CREATE(3PCAP)                                          PCAP_CREATE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_create - create a live capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_create(const char *source, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_create()  is  used  to  create  a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network.  source is a string that specifies the  network
       device  to  open;  on all supported Linux systems, as well as on recent
       versions of macOS and Solaris, a source argument of "any" or  NULL  can
       be  used  to  capture  packets from all network interfaces.  The latter
       should not be confused with all available capture devices  as  seen  by
       pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP), which may also include D-Bus, USB etc.  errbuf
       is a buffer large enough to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.

       The returned handle must be activated with pcap_activate(3PCAP)  before
       packets  can be captured with it; options for the capture, such as pro-
       miscuous mode, can be set on the handle before activating it.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_create() returns a pcap_t * on success and NULL  on  failure.   If
       NULL  is  returned,  errbuf is filled in with an appropriate error mes-
       sage.
