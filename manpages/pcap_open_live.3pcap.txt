PCAP_OPEN_LIVE(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_OPEN_LIVE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_open_live - open a device for capturing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_open_live(const char *device, int snaplen,
           int promisc, int to_ms, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_open_live()  is  used to obtain a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network.  device is a string that specifies the  network
       device  to  open;  on all supported Linux systems, as well as on recent
       versions of macOS and Solaris, a device argument of "any" or  NULL  can
       be  used  to  capture  packets from all network interfaces.  The latter
       should not be confused with all available capture devices  as  seen  by
       pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP), which may also include D-Bus, USB etc.

       snaplen  specifies the snapshot length to be set on the handle.  If the
       packet data should not be truncated at  the  end,  a  value  of  262144
       should  be  sufficient  for  most  devices, but D-Bus devices require a
       value of 128MB (128*1024*1024).

       promisc specifies whether the interface is to be put  into  promiscuous
       mode.   If promisc is non-zero, promiscuous mode will be set, otherwise
       it will not be set.

       to_ms specifies the packet buffer timeout, as a non-negative value,  in
       milliseconds.  (See pcap(3PCAP) for an explanation of the packet buffer
       timeout.)

       errbuf is a buffer large  enough  to  hold  at  least  PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
       chars.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_open_live() returns a pcap_t * on success and NULL on failure.  If
       NULL is returned, errbuf is filled in with an  appropriate  error  mes-
       sage.   errbuf  may  also  be set to warning text when pcap_open_live()
       succeeds; to detect this case the caller  should  store  a  zero-length
       string  in errbuf before calling pcap_open_live() and display the warn-
       ing to the user if errbuf is no longer a zero-length string.
