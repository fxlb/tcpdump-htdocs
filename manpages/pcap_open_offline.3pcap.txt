PCAP_OPEN_OFFLINE(3PCAP)                              PCAP_OPEN_OFFLINE(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_open_offline,             pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision,
       pcap_fopen_offline, pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision -  open  a
       saved capture file for reading

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_open_offline(const char *fname, char *errbuf);
       pcap_t *pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision(const char *fname,
           u_int precision, char *errbuf);
       pcap_t *pcap_fopen_offline(FILE *fp, char *errbuf);
       pcap_t *pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision(FILE *fp,
           u_int precision, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_open_offline()  and  pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision() are
       called to open a ``savefile'' for reading.

       fname specifies the name of the file to open. The  file  can  have  the
       pcap  file  format  as described in pcap-savefile(5), which is the file
       format used by, among other programs, tcpdump(1)  and  tcpslice(1),  or
       can  have  the pcapng file format, although not all pcapng files can be
       read.  The name "-" is a synonym for stdin.

       pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision() takes an additional precision
       argument    specifying   the   time   stamp   precision   desired;   if
       PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO is specified, packet time  stamps  will  be
       supplied in seconds and microseconds, and if PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO
       is specified, packet time  stamps  will  be  supplied  in  seconds  and
       nanoseconds.   If the time stamps in the file do not have the same pre-
       cision as the requested precision, they will be scaled up  or  down  as
       necessary before being supplied.

       Alternatively,  you  may  call  pcap_fopen_offline() or pcap_fopen_off-
       line_with_tstamp_precision() to read dumped data from an existing  open
       stream  fp;  this  stream  will  be  closed  by  a  subsequent  call to
       pcap_close   (3PCAP)   unless    it    is    stdin.     pcap_fopen_off-
       line_with_tstamp_precision()  takes an additional precision argument as
       described above.  Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in
       binary mode.

       errbuf  is  a  buffer  large  enough  to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
       chars.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_open_offline(),         pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision(),
       pcap_fopen_offline(),   and  pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision()
       return a pcap_t * on success and NULL on failure.  If NULL is returned,
       errbuf is filled in with an appropriate error message.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision()      and      pcap_fopen_off-
       line_with_tstamp_precision() became available in libpcap release 1.5.1.
       In  previous  releases, time stamps from a savefile are always given in
       seconds and microseconds.
