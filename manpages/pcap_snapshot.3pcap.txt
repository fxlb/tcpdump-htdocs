NAME
       pcap_snapshot - get the snapshot length

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_snapshot(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_snapshot()    returns   the   snapshot   length   specified   when
       pcap_set_snaplen(3PCAP) or pcap_open_live(3PCAP) was called, for a live
       capture,  or  the  snapshot length from the capture file, for a ``save-
       file''.

       It  must  not   be   called   on   a   pcap   descriptor   created   by
       pcap_create(3PCAP)    that    has    not    yet   been   activated   by
       pcap_activate(3PCAP).

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_snapshot() returns the snapshot length  on  success  and  PCAP_ER-
       ROR_NOT_ACTIVATED  if  called on a capture handle that has been created
       but not activated.
