PCAP_LIST_DATALINKS(3PCAP)                          PCAP_LIST_DATALINKS(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_list_datalinks,  pcap_free_datalinks  -  get  a list of link-layer
       header types supported by a capture device, and free that list

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_list_datalinks(pcap_t *p, int **dlt_buf);
       void pcap_free_datalinks(int *dlt_list);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_list_datalinks() is used to get a list of the supported link-layer
       header  types  of  the  interface  associated with the pcap descriptor.
       pcap_list_datalinks() allocates an array to  hold  the  list  and  sets
       *dlt_buf to point to that array.

       The    caller    is    responsible   for   freeing   the   array   with
       pcap_free_datalinks(), which frees the list of link-layer header  types
       pointed to by dlt_list.

       It   must   not   be   called   on   a   pcap   descriptor  created  by
       pcap_create(3PCAP)   that   has   not    yet    been    activated    by
       pcap_activate(3PCAP).

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_list_datalinks()  returns the number of link-layer header types in
       the array on success, PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if called on  a  capture
       handle that has been created but not activated, and PCAP_ERROR on other
       errors.    If   PCAP_ERROR   is   returned,    pcap_geterr(3PCAP)    or
       pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an argument to fetch or dis-
       play the error text.
