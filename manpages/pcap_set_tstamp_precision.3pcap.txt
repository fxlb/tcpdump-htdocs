PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION(3PCAP)              PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision  -  set  the time stamp precision returned in
       captures

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_tstamp_precision(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_precision);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision() sets the precision of the  time  stamp  de-
       sired for packets captured on the pcap descriptor to the type specified
       by tstamp_precision.  It must be called on a pcap descriptor created by
       pcap_create(3PCAP)  that  has  not  yet  been  activated  by pcap_acti-
       vate(3PCAP).  Two time stamp precisions are supported, microseconds and
       nanoseconds.   One  can  use  options  PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO  and
       PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO to request desired  precision.  By  default,
       time stamps are in microseconds.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision()  returns 0 on success if the specified time
       stamp precision is expected to be  supported  by  the  capture  device,
       PCAP_ERROR_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NOTSUP  if the capture device does not sup-
       port the requested time stamp precision, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if called
       on a capture handle that has been activated.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This  function  became available in libpcap release 1.5.1.  In previous
       releases, time stamps from a capture  device  or  savefile  are  always
       given in seconds and microseconds.
