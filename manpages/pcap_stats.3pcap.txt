PCAP_STATS(3PCAP)                                            PCAP_STATS(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_stats - get capture statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_stats(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_stat *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_stats() fills in the struct pcap_stat pointed to by its second ar-
       gument.  The values represent packet statistics from the start  of  the
       run to the time of the call.

       pcap_stats()  is supported only on live captures, not on ``savefiles'';
       no statistics are stored in ``savefiles'', so no statistics are  avail-
       able when reading from a ``savefile''.

       A struct pcap_stat has the following members:

              ps_recv
                     number of packets received;

              ps_drop
                     number  of  packets  dropped because there was no room in
                     the operating system's buffer when they arrived,  because
                     packets weren't being read fast enough;

              ps_ifdrop
                     number of packets dropped by the network interface or its
                     driver.

       The statistics do not behave the same way on  all  platforms.   ps_recv
       might  count  packets whether they passed any filter set with pcap_set-
       filter(3PCAP) or not, or it might count only packets that pass the fil-
       ter.   It also might, or might not, count packets dropped because there
       was no room  in  the  operating  system's  buffer  when  they  arrived.
       ps_drop  is  not  available  on  all platforms; it is zero on platforms
       where it's not available.  If packet  filtering  is  done  in  libpcap,
       rather  than in the operating system, it would count packets that don't
       pass the filter.  Both ps_recv and ps_drop might, or might  not,  count
       packets not yet read from the operating system and thus not yet seen by
       the application.  ps_ifdrop might, or might  not,  be  implemented;  if
       it's  zero,  that might mean that no packets were dropped by the inter-
       face, or it might mean that the statistic is unavailable, so it  should
       not  be  treated  as  an indication that the interface did not drop any
       packets.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_stats() returns 0 on success, PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED  if  called
       on  a  capture  handle  that  has  been  created  but not activated, or
       PCAP_ERROR if there is another error or if  p  doesn't  support  packet
       statistics.  If PCAP_ERROR is returned, pcap_geterr(3PCAP) or pcap_per-
       ror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an argument to fetch or display  the
       error text.
