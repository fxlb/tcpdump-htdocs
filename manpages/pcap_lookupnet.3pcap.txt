PCAP_LOOKUPNET(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_LOOKUPNET(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_lookupnet - find the IPv4 network number and netmask for a device

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       int pcap_lookupnet(const char *device, bpf_u_int32 *netp,
           bpf_u_int32 *maskp, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_lookupnet()  is used to determine the IPv4 network number and mask
       associated with the network device device.  Both  netp  and  maskp  are
       bpf_u_int32  pointers,  on  success  both values will be set in network
       byte order.  errbuf is a buffer large enough to hold at least  PCAP_ER-
       RBUF_SIZE chars.

       This  function  is  not available on Windows.  It supports neither IPv6
       nor multiple IPv4 addresses per interface, which obviously is not prac-
       tical in modern networks.  See pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP) for a more elab-
       orate solution to the problem.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_lookupnet() returns 0 on success and  PCAP_ERROR  on  failure.  If
       PCAP_ERROR  is  returned, errbuf is filled in with an appropriate error
       message.
