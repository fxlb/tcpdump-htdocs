<H2 id="lbAB">NAME</H2>

pcap_findalldevs, pcap_freealldevs - get a list of capture devices, and
free that list
<H2 id="lbAC">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
</B>
<B>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
</B>
<B>int pcap_findalldevs(pcap_if_t **alldevsp, char *errbuf);
void pcap_freealldevs(pcap_if_t *alldevs);
</B></PRE>

<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_findalldevs</B>()

constructs a list of network devices that can be opened with
<A HREF='./pcap_create.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_create</B></A>(3PCAP)

and
<A HREF='./pcap_activate.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_activate</B></A>(3PCAP)

or with
<A HREF='./pcap_open_live.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_open_live</B></A>(3PCAP).

(Note that there may be network devices that cannot be opened by the
process calling
<B>pcap_findalldevs</B>(),

because, for example, that process does not have sufficient privileges
to open them for capturing; if so, those devices will not appear on the
list.)
<I>alldevsp</I>

is a pointer to a
<CODE>pcap_if_t *</CODE>;

<I>errbuf</I>

is a buffer large enough to hold at least
<CODE>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</CODE>

chars.
<P>

If
<B>pcap_findalldevs</B>()

succeeds, the pointer pointed to by
<I>alldevsp</I>

is set to point to the first element of the list, or to
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

if no devices were found (this is considered success).
Each element of the list is of type
<CODE>pcap_if_t</CODE>,

and has the following members:
<DL><DT><DD>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>next</CODE>

<DD>
if not
<CODE>NULL</CODE>,

a pointer to the next element in the list;
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

for the last element of the list
<DT><CODE>name</CODE>

<DD>
a pointer to a string giving a name for the device to pass to
<B>pcap_open_live</B>()

<DT><CODE>description</CODE>

<DD>
if not
<CODE>NULL</CODE>,

a pointer to a string giving a human-readable description of the device
<DT><CODE>addresses</CODE>

<DD>
a pointer to the first element of a list of network addresses for the
device,
or
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

if the device has no addresses
<DT><CODE>flags</CODE>

<DD>
device flags:
<DL><DT><DD>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK</CODE>

<DD>
set if the device is a loopback interface
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_UP</CODE>

<DD>
set if the device is up
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</CODE>

<DD>
set if the device is running
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</CODE>

<DD>
set if the device is a wireless interface; this includes IrDA as well as
radio-based networks such as IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11, so it
doesn't just mean Wi-Fi
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</CODE>

<DD>
a bitmask for an indication of whether the adapter is connected or not;
for wireless interfaces, &quot;connected&quot; means &quot;associated with a network&quot;
<DT>The possible values for the connection status bits are:<DD>
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</CODE>

<DD>
it's unknown whether the adapter is connected or not
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</CODE>

<DD>
the adapter is connected
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</CODE>

<DD>
the adapter is disconnected
<DT><CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE</CODE>

<DD>
the notion of &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;disconnected&quot; don't apply to this
interface; for example, it doesn't apply to a loopback device
</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Each element of the list of addresses is of type
<CODE>pcap_addr_t</CODE>,

and has the following members:
<DL><DT><DD>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>next</CODE>

<DD>
if not
<CODE>NULL</CODE>,

a pointer to the next element in the list;
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

for the last element of the list
<DT><CODE>addr</CODE>

<DD>
a pointer to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE>

containing an address
<DT><CODE>netmask</CODE>

<DD>
if not
<CODE>NULL</CODE>,

a pointer to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE>

that contains the netmask corresponding to the address pointed to by
<CODE>addr</CODE>

<DT><CODE>broadaddr</CODE>

<DD>
if not
<CODE>NULL</CODE>,

a pointer to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE>

that contains the broadcast address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
<CODE>addr</CODE>;

may be
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

if the device doesn't support broadcasts
<DT><CODE>dstaddr</CODE>

<DD>
if not
<CODE>NULL</CODE>,

a pointer to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE>

that contains the destination address corresponding to the address pointed
to by
<CODE>addr</CODE>;

may be
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

if the device isn't a point-to-point interface
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4
addresses, IPv6 addresses, or some other type of addresses, so you must
check the
<CODE>sa_family</CODE>

member of the
<CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE>

before interpreting the contents of the address; do not assume that the
addresses are all IPv4 addresses, or even all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
IPv4 addresses have the value
<CODE>AF_INET</CODE>,

IPv6 addresses have the value
<CODE>AF_INET6</CODE>

(which older operating systems that don't support IPv6 might not
define), and other addresses have other values.  Whether other addresses
are returned, and what types they might have is platform-dependent.
Namely, link-layer addresses, such as Ethernet MAC addresses, have the value
<CODE>AF_PACKET</CODE>

(on Linux) or
<CODE>AF_LINK</CODE>

(on AIX, FreeBSD, Haiku, illumos, macOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD) or are not
returned at all (on GNU/Hurd and Solaris).
<P>

For IPv4 addresses, the
<CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE>

pointer can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr_in</CODE>;

for IPv6 addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr_in6.</CODE>

For link-layer addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
<CODE>struct sockaddr_ll</CODE>

(for
<CODE>AF_PACKET</CODE>)

or a
<CODE>struct sockaddr_dl</CODE>

(for
<CODE>AF_LINK</CODE>).

<P>

The list of devices must be freed with
<A HREF='./pcap_findalldevs.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_freealldevs</B></A>(3PCAP),

which frees the list pointed to by
<I>alldevs</I>.

<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_findalldevs</B>()

returns
<B>0</B>

on success and
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

on failure; as indicated, finding no
devices is considered success, rather than failure, so
<B>0</B>

will be
returned in that case. If
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

is returned,
<I>errbuf</I>

is filled in with an appropriate error message,
and the pointer pointed to by
<I>alldevsp</I>

is set to
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<H2 id="lbAF">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</H2>

<P>

The
<CODE>PCAP_IF_UP</CODE>

and
<CODE>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</CODE>

constants became available in libpcap release 1.6.1.  The
<CODE>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</CODE>,

<CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</CODE>,

<CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</CODE>,

<CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</CODE>,

<CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</CODE>,

and
<CODE>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE</CODE>

constants became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.
