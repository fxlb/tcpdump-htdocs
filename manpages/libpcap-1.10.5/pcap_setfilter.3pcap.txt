PCAP_SETFILTER(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_SETFILTER(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_setfilter - set the filter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_setfilter(pcap_t *p, struct bpf_program *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_setfilter()  is used to specify a filter program.  fp is a pointer
       to  a  bpf_program  struct,  usually  the   result   of   a   call   to
       pcap_compile(3PCAP).

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_setfilter()  returns  0  on  success,  PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED if
       called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,  or
       PCAP_ERROR    on    other   errors.    If   PCAP_ERROR   is   returned,
       pcap_geterr(3PCAP) or pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an ar-
       gument to fetch or display the error text.
