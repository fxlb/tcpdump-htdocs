<H2 id="lbAB">NAME</H2>

pcap_next_ex, pcap_next - read the next packet from a pcap_t
<H2 id="lbAC">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
</B>
<B>int pcap_next_ex(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr **pkt_header,
    const u_char **pkt_data);
const u_char *pcap_next(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr *h);
</B></PRE>

<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_next_ex</B>()

reads the next packet and returns a success/failure indication.
If the packet was read without problems, the pointer pointed to by the
<I>pkt_header</I>

argument is set to point to the
<CODE>pcap_pkthdr</CODE>

struct for the packet, and the
pointer pointed to by the
<I>pkt_data</I>

argument is set to point to the data in the packet.  The
<CODE>struct pcap_pkthdr</CODE>

and the packet data are not to be freed by the caller, and are not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
<B>pcap_next_ex</B>(),

<B>pcap_next</B>(),

<A HREF='./pcap_loop.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_loop</B></A>(3PCAP),

or
<A HREF='./pcap_loop.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_dispatch</B></A>(3PCAP);

if the code needs them to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.
<P>

<B>pcap_next</B>()

reads the next packet (by calling
<B>pcap_dispatch</B>()

with a
<I>cnt</I>

of 1) and returns a
<CODE>u_char</CODE>

pointer to the data in that packet.  The
packet data is not to be freed by the caller, and is not
guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
<B>pcap_next_ex</B>(),

<B>pcap_next</B>(),

<B>pcap_loop</B>(),

or
<B>pcap_dispatch</B>();

if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a copy of it.
The
<CODE>pcap_pkthdr</CODE>

structure pointed to by
<I>h</I>

is filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.
<P>

The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.  The
format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
<A HREF='./pcap_datalink.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_datalink</B></A>(3PCAP)

routine when handed the
<CODE>pcap_t</CODE>

value also passed to
<B>pcap_loop</B>()

or
<B>pcap_dispatch</B>().

<I><A HREF="https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html">https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</A></I>

lists the values
<B>pcap_datalink</B>()

can return and describes the packet formats that
correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid for all
packets received unless and until
<A HREF='./pcap_set_datalink.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_set_datalink</B></A>(3PCAP)

is called; after a successful call to
<B>pcap_set_datalink</B>(),

all subsequent packets will have a link-layer header of the type
specified by the link-layer header type value passed to
<B>pcap_set_datalink</B>().

<P>

Do
<B>NOT</B>

assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile`` will have
any given link-layer header type, such as
<CODE>DLT_EN10MB</CODE>

for Ethernet.  For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on Linux will have a
link-layer header type of
<CODE>DLT_LINUX_SLL</CODE>

or
<CODE>DLT_LINUX_SLL2</CODE>

even if all devices on the system at the time the &quot;any&quot; device is opened
have some other data link type, such as
<CODE>DLT_EN10MB</CODE>

for Ethernet.
<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_next_ex</B>()

returns
<B>1</B>

if the packet was read without problems,
<B>0</B>

if packets are
being read from a live capture and the packet buffer timeout expired,
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</CODE>

if packets
are being read from a ``savefile'' and there are no more packets to read
from the savefile,
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</CODE>

if called on a capture handle that has been created but not activated,
or
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

if an error occurred while reading the packet.  If
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

is returned,
<A HREF='./pcap_geterr.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_geterr</B></A>(3PCAP)

or
<A HREF='./pcap_geterr.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_perror</B></A>(3PCAP)

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
<P>

<B>pcap_next</B>()

returns a pointer to the packet data on success, and returns
<CODE>NULL</CODE>

if an error occurred, or if no packets were read from a live capture
(if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't pass the
packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a packet buffer timeout
that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires before any
packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device is in
non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no
more packets are available in a ``savefile.'' Unfortunately, there is no
way to determine whether an error occurred or not.
