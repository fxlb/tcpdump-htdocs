PCAP_LIB_VERSION(3PCAP)                                PCAP_LIB_VERSION(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_lib_version - get the version information for libpcap

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       const char *pcap_lib_version(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_lib_version()  returns  a  pointer  to a string giving information
       about the version of the libpcap library being used.  The string begins
       with  the  words  "libpcap version" and a space.  Then follows the ver-
       sion, which consists of three dot-separated numbers  and  the  optional
       "-PRE-GIT"  suffix  to  indicate a development snapshot, same as in the
       output of pcap-config --version  in  sufficiently  recent  libpcap  re-
       leases.   After the version often follow a space and additional text in
       an arbitrary human-readable form to indicate particular features.   For
       example:

       an old release, on any OS
              libpcap version 1.5.3

       a newer release on a Linux host
              libpcap version 1.10.4 (with TPACKET_V3)

       the same, built with DAG support only
              libpcap version 1.10.4 (DAG-only)

       a development snapshot on a FreeBSD host
              libpcap version 1.11.0-PRE-GIT (64-bit time_t, with zerocopy and netmap support)
