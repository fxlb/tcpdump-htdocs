PCAP_LIB_VERSION(3PCAP)                                PCAP_LIB_VERSION(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_lib_version - get the version information for libpcap

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       const char *pcap_lib_version(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_lib_version()  returns  a  pointer  to a string giving information
       about the version of the libpcap library being used.  The string begins
       with the words "libpcap version".  Then follows the version, which con-
       sists of three dot-separated numbers and the optional "-PRE-GIT" suffix
       to  indicate a development snapshot, same as in the output of pcap-con-
       fig --version in sufficiently recent libpcap releases.  After the  ver-
       sion  often  follows  additional  text to indicate particular features.
       For example:

       an old release, on any OS
              libpcap version 1.5.3

       a newer release on a Linux host
              libpcap version 1.10.4 (with TPACKET_V3)

       the same, built with DAG support only
              libpcap version 1.10.4 (DAG-only)

       a development snapshot on a FreeBSD host
              libpcap version 1.11.0-PRE-GIT (with zerocopy support)
