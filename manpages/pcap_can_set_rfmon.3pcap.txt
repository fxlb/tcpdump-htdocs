PCAP_CAN_SET_RFMON(3PCAP)                            PCAP_CAN_SET_RFMON(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_can_set_rfmon  -  check whether monitor mode can be set for a not-
       yet-activated capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_can_set_rfmon(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_can_set_rfmon() checks whether monitor mode could be set on a cap-
       ture handle when the handle is activated.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_can_set_rfmon()  returns  0 if monitor mode could not be set, 1 if
       monitor mode could be set, and a negative value on error.   A  negative
       return value indicates what error condition occurred.  The possible er-
       ror values are:

       PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE
              The capture source specified when the handle was created doesn't
              exist.

       PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED
              The  process  doesn't  have  permission to check whether monitor
              mode could be supported.

       PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED
              The capture handle has already been activated.

       PCAP_ERROR
              Another     error     occurred.       pcap_geterr(3PCAP)      or
              pcap_perror(3PCAP)  may be called with p as an argument to fetch
              or display a message describing the error.

       Additional error codes may be added in the  future;  a  program  should
       check  for 0, 1, and negative, return codes, and treat all negative re-
       turn codes as errors.  pcap_statustostr(3PCAP) can be  called,  with  a
       warning or error code as an argument, to fetch a message describing the
       warning or error code.
