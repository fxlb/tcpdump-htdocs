PCAP_SETFILTER(3PCAP)                                    PCAP_SETFILTER(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_setfilter - set the filter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_setfilter(pcap_t *p, struct bpf_program *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_setfilter()  is used to specify a filter program.  fp is a pointer
       to  a  bpf_program  struct,  usually  the   result   of   a   call   to
       pcap_compile(3PCAP).

       If the calls to pcap_compile() and pcap_setfilter() use the same pcap_t
       handle, packet filtering should either work correctly or fail correctly
       without  additional  efforts.   Otherwise  the filter program must have
       been compiled for the same link-layer header type as the  one  used  by
       the  pcap_t  handle;  also  on Linux the filter must not use BPF exten-
       sions, see pcap_compile() for more information.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_setfilter() returns  0  on  success,  PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED  if
       called  on a capture handle that has been created but not activated, or
       PCAP_ERROR   on   other   errors.    If   PCAP_ERROR    is    returned,
       pcap_geterr(3PCAP) or pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an ar-
       gument to fetch or display the error text.
