<H2 id="lbAB">NAME</H2>

pcap_compile - compile a filter expression
<H2 id="lbAC">SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;
</B>
<B>int pcap_compile(pcap_t *p, struct bpf_program *fp,
    const char *str, int optimize, bpf_u_int32 netmask);
</B></PRE>

<H2 id="lbAD">DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>pcap_compile</B>()

is used to compile the string
<I>str</I>

into a filter program.  See
<B><A HREF="./pcap-filter.7.html">pcap-filter</A></B>(7)

for the syntax of that string.
<I>fp</I>

is a pointer to a
<I>bpf_program</I>

struct and is filled in by
<B>pcap_compile</B>().

<I>optimize</I>

controls whether optimization on the resulting code is performed.
<I>netmask</I>

specifies the IPv4 netmask of the network on which packets are being
captured; it is used only when checking for IPv4 broadcast addresses in
the filter program.  If the netmask of the network on which packets are
being captured isn't known to the program, or if packets are being
captured on the Linux &quot;any&quot; pseudo-interface that can capture on more
than one network, a value of
<CODE>PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN</CODE>

can be supplied; tests
for IPv4 broadcast addresses will fail to compile, but all other tests in
the filter program will be OK.
<P>

On Linux, if the
<CODE>pcap_t</CODE>

handle corresponds to a live packet capture, the resulting filter program
may use Linux BPF extensions.  This works transparently if the filter
program is used to filter packets on the same
<CODE>pcap_t</CODE>

handle, which should be done when possible.  In other use cases trying to
use a filter program with BPF extensions in
<A HREF='./pcap_offline_filter.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_offline_filter</B></A>(3PCAP)

or for filtering an input savefile would reject more packets than expected
because the extensions depend on auxiliary packet data, which would not be
available.  The workaround is to compile the filter without the extensions
by using a
<CODE>pcap_t</CODE>

handle from
<A HREF='./pcap_open_dead.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_open_dead</B></A>(3PCAP)

or
<A HREF='./pcap_open_offline.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_open_offline</B></A>(3PCAP)

rather than a handle from
<A HREF='./pcap_create.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_create</B></A>(3PCAP)

or
<A HREF='./pcap_open_live.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_open_live</B></A>(3PCAP).

<P>

If BPF extensions are disabled as described above or the OS is not Linux,
<B>pcap_compile</B>()

may start rejecting some filter expressions for some link-layer header types,
this is the expected behaviour.  For example, the
<CODE>ifindex</CODE>

keyword is valid for any live capture on Linux, but when reading packets
from a savefile, regardless of the OS it is valid for
<CODE>DLT_LINUX_SLL2</CODE>

only.
<H2 id="lbAE">RETURN VALUE</H2>

<B>pcap_compile</B>()

returns
<B>0</B>

on success and
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

on failure. If
<CODE>PCAP_ERROR</CODE>

is returned,
<A HREF='./pcap_geterr.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_geterr</B></A>(3PCAP)

or
<A HREF='./pcap_geterr.3pcap.html'><B>pcap_perror</B></A>(3PCAP)

may be called with
<I>p</I>

as an argument to fetch or display the error text.
<H2 id="lbAF">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</H2>

<P>

The
<CODE>PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN</CODE>

constant became available in libpcap release 1.1.0.
<P>

In libpcap 1.8.0 and later,
<B>pcap_compile</B>()

can be used in multiple threads within a single process.  However, in
earlier versions of libpcap, it is
<I>not</I>

safe to use
<B>pcap_compile</B>()

in multiple threads in a single process without some form of mutual
exclusion allowing only one thread to call it at any given time.
