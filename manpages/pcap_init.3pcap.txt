PCAP_INIT(3PCAP)                                              PCAP_INIT(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_init - initialize the library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       int pcap_init(unsigned int opts, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_init()  is  used  to  initialize the Packet Capture library.  opts
       specifies options for the library; errbuf is a buffer large  enough  to
       hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.

       Currently, the options that can be specified in opts are:

       PCAP_MMAP_32BIT
              Map packet buffers with 32-bit addresses.

       PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL
              Treat  all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings
              to the caller, as being in the local character encoding.

       PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8
              Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all  strings
              to the caller, as being in UTF-8.

       On  UNIX-like  systems,  the  local character encoding is assumed to be
       UTF-8, so no character encoding transformations are done.

       On Windows, the local character encoding is the local ANSI code page.

       If pcap_init() is not called, strings are treated as being in the local
       ANSI  code page on Windows, pcap_lookupdev(3PCAP) will succeed if there
       is a device on which to capture, and pcap_create(3PCAP)  makes  an  at-
       tempt  to  check whether the string passed as an argument is a UTF-16LE
       string - note that this attempt is unsafe, as it may run past  the  end
       of the string - to handle pcap_lookupdev() returning a UTF-16LE string.
       Programs  that  don't  call  pcap_init()  should,  on   Windows,   call
       pcap_wsockinit()  to  initialize  Winsock;  this  is  not  necessary if
       pcap_init() is called, as pcap_init() will initialize Winsock itself on
       Windows.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_init()  returns  0  on  success  and  PCAP_ERROR  on  failure.  If
       PCAP_ERROR is returned, errbuf is filled in with an  appropriate  error
       message.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This  function  became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.  In previous
       releases, on Windows,  all  strings  supplied  as  arguments,  and  all
       strings returned to the caller, are in the local character encoding.
