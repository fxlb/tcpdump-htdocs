PCAP_SET_TIMEOUT(3PCAP)                                PCAP_SET_TIMEOUT(3PCAP)

NAME
       pcap_set_timeout  -  set  the packet buffer timeout for a not-yet-acti-
       vated capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_timeout(pcap_t *p, int to_ms);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_timeout() sets the packet buffer timeout that will be used  on
       a  capture  handle  when  the handle is activated to to_ms, which is in
       units of milliseconds.  (See pcap(3PCAP)  for  an  explanation  of  the
       packet buffer timeout.)

       The  behavior,  if the timeout isn't specified, is undefined, as is the
       behavior if the timeout is set to zero or to a negative value.  We rec-
       ommend  always setting the timeout to a non-zero value unless immediate
       mode is set, in which case the timeout has no effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_timeout() returns 0  on  success  or  PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED  if
       called on a capture handle that has been activated.
